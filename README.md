# SocialRobot
This is all the code that is being used in the inflatable social robot my team and I are building for senior research at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.

We are using OpenAI's davinci engine to generate responses and pyttsx3 and gtts packages as intermediaries for the text to speech and speech to text functionalities. Our inspiration for this project was Baymax, the robot from Big Hero 6.
