# SocialRobot
This is all the code that is being used in the inflatable social robot senior research project at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.

We are using OpenAI's davinci engine to generate responses and pyttsx3 and gtts packages as intermediaries for the text to speech and speech to text functionalities. Our inspiration for this project was Baymax, the robot from Big Hero 6.

The physical robot has a soft plastic exterior and has a raspberry pi as an onboard controller for the motors and audio system. These components along with all software for this project was designed at the Automation and Robotics Lab.
